Here I'll describe the buckets that I put games into for how much I enjoyed them.

There are eight in total, numbered 0 to 7, which is unconventional, but I feel that is just the optimal number of buckets.  Most video game reviewers that apply ratings to the games usually use a 10-point scale but don't [utilize the lower end](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/18fbo5/i_created_a_histogram_of_201_of_the_most_recent/) anyway.

## 0

These are worst games of all time.  They are unique in how offensively bad they are.

Equivalent to 0-39 on Metacritic (2nd percentile and below), e.g. *Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing (2003)*.

## 1

These are horrible games.

Equivalent to 40-54 on Metacritic (2nd to 10th percentile), e.g. *Duke Nukem Forever (2011)*.

## 2

These are bad games.

Equivalent to 55-66 on Metacritic (10th to 30th percentile), e.g. *APB: Reloaded (2011)*.

## 3

These are mediocre games.  Below average to average.

Equivalent to 66-72 on Metacritic (30th to 50th percentile), e.g. *Gratuitous Space Battles (2009)*.

## 4

These are decent games.  Average to above average.

Equivalent to 73-78 on Metacritic (50th to 70th percentile), e.g. *Heavy Rain (2010)*.

## 5

These are good games.

Equivalent to 79-83 on Metacritic (70th to 90th percentile), e.g. *Life is Strange (2015)*. 

## 6

These games are excellent games.

Equivalent to 84-89 on Metacritic (90th to 98th percentile), e.g. *Left 4 Dead 2 (2009)*.

## 7

These are the best games of all time.  That doesn't mean they're perfect.  However, they are paragons of challenging and rewarding gameplay and/or immersive and interesting game worlds.

Equivalent to 90-100 on Metacritic (98th percentile and up), e.g. *Mass Effect 2 (2012)*.
